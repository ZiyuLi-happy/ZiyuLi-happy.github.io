I'm a senior year high school student from Guangdong Country Garden School (https://bgy.gd.cn/). My research interest includes biology, biological engineering, genome regulation, neurological, Immunology, bioinformatics, and programming.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Academician Yan Xiaojun from Jiangsu Antae Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and Prof. Xiao Yang of Immunology Lab from Qianhai Shekou Free Trade Zone Hospital (https://www.skhosp.cn/index.aspx), and also my high school biology teacher Mr. Wu Taigang, who guided me to enroll for the S.-T. Yau High School Science Competition(biology).

You can find my CV here: [Li Ziyu's Curriculum Vitae] (../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
